# My Early Works

These pieces are among my earliest works. Each of them has a unique story, reflecting my development and evolving techniques.

## My Early Creations

### 1. **Pastel Drawing: The Turtle**

The turtle’s head and shell turned out particularly well, with blue, purple, and yellow shades adding depth and realism to the image. The careful blending of colors highlights the intricate patterns of the shell, almost bringing the drawing to life. The interplay of colors enhances the three-dimensional effect, making it feel as if the turtle might move at any moment.

**Technical Details:**

- **Paper:** A4 Diamond paper
- **Drawing:** Hard pastel, Gioconda

### 2. **Pastel Drawing: The Sunken Church**

This artwork creates a striking contrast between the deep blue shades of the water and sky and the warm tones of the church tower emerging from the waves. The colorful clock face of the tower forms a vivid focal point, enriching the composition with intricate details. The dominant blue hues represent the vast sky and surrounding waters, while the partially submerged church tower on the right side of the drawing captivates the viewer.

The door itself shines in a vibrant green, while the lush red flowers around it add warmth and elegance to the composition. In the foreground, the sandy ground is rendered with a mix of orange, blue, and green tones, effectively capturing the atmosphere and depth of the space in front of the gate.

## Reflecting on These Works

Looking back at these pieces, I see the foundation of my artistic journey. They represent key milestones in my growth, as they were my first experiments with colors, textures, and compositions. Many who have seen these artworks have appreciated the intricate details of the turtle’s shell, the symbolism of the sunken tower, and the vibrant contrasts of the Mediterranean gate.

## Moving Forward

These early works have helped shape my artistic identity, and I am excited to continue experimenting with new techniques and themes. I look forward to sharing more of my evolving creations in the future.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey!
