# The Church of Bárna in Watercolor

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Recently, I completed the **watercolor version of the church of Bárna**. Bárna is my hometown, which makes this painting especially meaningful to me. A few years ago, I had already drawn this building in pastel, but I always wanted to create a painted version of it.
</p>   

When creating the piece, I aimed to capture the **distinctive features of the church**:  
- the **red roof**, shining vividly in the landscape,  
- the **white walls**, brought to life by soft shadows,  
- and the **blue sky**, framing the entire scene.  

## Technical Details

- **Paper**: 300 g/m² Fabriano watercolor paper, 50×35 cm  
- **Paints**: I used softer blue tones in the background and violet-blue shades for the retaining wall. Warm yellow hues emphasize the cozy atmosphere of the church.  
- **Brushes**: I achieved delicate effects using various sizes of flat and round brushes.  

## Reflections on the New Painting

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I feel that in the watercolor version, I managed to paint the church in a more realistic and natural way. During the process, I learned even more about the possibilities of watercolor and discovered how to adapt the medium to my own artistic goals. I hope this piece also touches the viewer and conveys the atmosphere of the church.

Here is the earlier pastel version:

## Two Paintings – Two Approaches

In the **pastel** version, the focus was on **color saturation and contrast**. Due to its thick and textured surface, the artwork feels more expressive and bold.  
In contrast, the **watercolor** version emphasizes **subtlety, transparency, and lightness**. The flow of water and the blending tones helped create a softer, airier impression of the church and its surroundings.

For me, this painting carries a sense of calmness and timelessness. The church represents both the past and present of the community, and it was a joy to bring it to life with a brush.
