# Male Nude in Charcoal – A Study of the Human Form

The human body has always been one of the most fascinating and expressive subjects in visual art. My latest piece is a **charcoal figure drawing**, depicting a nude male standing half-turned away from me, leaning against a table with his muscular form prominently displayed.

## The creation of the drawing

This A3-sized work was made from a live model. The pose felt natural, yet full of strength: the tension in the back muscles and shoulders is carefully captured on the paper. Charcoal allowed me to render subtle tones and strong contrasts to express the volume, shadows, and texture of the body.

## What this drawing means to me

This piece was not only a technical challenge, but also required deep focus and attention to truly understand the forms of the human body. Charcoal is a raw yet sensitive medium—much like the human figure itself, which conveys both strength and vulnerability. To me, this drawing speaks of **concentration, presence, and focused attention**.
