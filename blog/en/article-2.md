# Morning Mist

My painting titled "Morning Mist" was created during a painting workshop where a renowned artist skillfully demonstrated the intricacies of watercolor techniques. Throughout the process, I aimed to follow the instructions and replicate their style while incorporating my own emotions into the composition.

## Inspiration

The painting was inspired by a winter morning scene, where the mist blanketed the landscape, and the silhouettes of trees barely emerged from the milky haze. During the workshop, the instructor encouraged us to capture this serene, natural beauty using watercolor, which turned out to be the perfect medium for conveying the ethereal atmosphere.

## Technical Details

- **Paper**: 150 g/mÂ² cold-pressed watercolor paper, which holds water well and provides a beautiful texture.
- **Paints**: I used ultramarine blue for the cool tones, cadmium yellow for warm accents, and charcoal for the grays.
- **Brushes**: Soft, flat brushes were used to achieve smooth transitions.

## Painting Process

Under the instructorâ€™s guidance, we first sketched the composition with a pencil, indicating subtle tonal transitions. Then, the instructor demonstrated how to create the misty background using delicate gradients. The blurred edges were achieved with wet-on-wet techniques to maintain the softness of the mist. The silhouettes of buildings and shrubs were enhanced with charcoal to bring out subtle details while preserving the dreamlike quality of the composition.

## A Message to Viewers

For me, "Morning Mist" is more than just a painting â€” itâ€™s a reminder of the learning journey and the wonders that can be achieved with watercolor techniques. I hope this artwork brings peace and inspiration to everyone who views it.
