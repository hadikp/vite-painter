# Watercolor Cliff Wall â€“ The Experience of a Public Painting Session

I recently took part in a **public painting event** organized by the **JancsÃ³ Art Gallery**, where I had the opportunity to create a large watercolor piece. The unique atmosphere of the event and the joy of painting together inspired me to create something out of the ordinary.  
**Location:** [JancsÃ³ Art Gallery Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/JancsoArtGallery)

## Creating the Artwork

My painting is a **50Ã—35 cm watercolor** depicting a **castle wall**. Although the stone surface is mostly grey, the final result turned out to be full of colors and subtle tones. Two **windows** open onto a **distant sea island**, where gentle waves and coastal beauty create a captivating view.

This contrast â€“ the closed, solid wall and the open seascape beyond the windows â€“ gave the piece a special tension and depth. It felt as if the wall represented not just a physical boundary but a conceptual passage between two worlds.

## What This Painting Meant to Me

This work was not only an exploration of composition and light-shadow play, but also a kind of escape â€“ a colorful island in the greyness of everyday life. The freedom of watercolor and the spontaneity of color allowed me to let go of precision and focus more on mood and atmosphere.
