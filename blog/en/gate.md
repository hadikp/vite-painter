# Mediterranean Gate â€“ Watercolor Painting

This painting is a meticulously crafted watercolor artwork depicting a Mediterranean gate. During the painting process, I paid special attention to the details and the subtle transitions of colors, creating a dreamlike yet vibrant atmosphere.

## The Creative Process

I painted this piece **step by step, with great attention to detail**. Taking advantage of the unique properties of watercolor, I allowed the colors to blend freely while preserving the delicate structure of the composition. The shadows were formed using soft purples and pale reds, reflecting the warmth of Mediterranean light.

The **staircase** behind the gate adds depth to the painting, while the **flower pots on the steps** bring life to the scene with their vibrant colors. The harmony of hues and the delicate watercolor flows create a natural ambiance, transporting the viewer to a tranquil, sunlit afternoon.

## Colors and Techniques

- **Paper:** 300 g/mÂ² Fabriano watercolor paper, 35x29 cm
- **Shadows:** A mix of purple and pale red, providing gentle contrast while maintaining the playful nature of sunlight.
- **Painting technique:** The painting was built up meticulously with intricate details, combining both wet and dry brushstrokes to create a dynamic effect.

## Reflections on the Painting

For me, this artwork symbolizes the **serenity and timelessness** of the Mediterranean. During the creative process, I became completely immersed in the details, enjoying how the colors and shapes came together. I hope viewers can also feel this warm and intimate atmosphere when they look at the painting.
