# Morning Fog in My Own Version

This watercolor painting is a reimagined version of my previously created piece, "Morning Fog." This new version fully reflects my own emotions and perspective while preserving the original inspiration: the serene and mysterious beauty of a landscape shrouded in mist.

## The Reinterpretation Process

After completing the first version, I thought a lot about how I could bring this theme closer to my own style. My goal was to emphasize the mystical nature of the fog even more and to work with softer, more subdued shades. I also aimed to deepen the atmosphere of the background, allowing the viewer to immerse themselves more in the quiet, early morning landscape.

## Technical Details

- **Paper**: 300 g/mÂ² Fabriano watercolor paper, 50x35cm
- **Paints**: I used softer blue tones in the background and more shades of purple for the foreground ground.
- **Brushes**: I experimented with different sizes of flat brushes to achieve even more delicate effects.

## The Painting Process

First, I wet the entire paper so that the colors would spread softly, creating a natural fog effect. I applied the first layer with light colors, then gradually transitioned to darker shades in the subsequent layers. I highlighted details with a dry brush and fine strokes to give the painting a dreamy, floating effect.

I used the alla prima technique, which means painting the entire composition at once without allowing the paint to fully dry. This method results in a highly dynamic and emotionally expressive outcome, especially in watercolor, where colors naturally blend and flow together. This painting approach keeps the composition fresh and spontaneous while supporting the organic merging and natural vibrancy of the colors.

## Thoughts on the New Painting

This second version feels closer to me because it fully represents my own vision. Through the creative process, I gained a deeper understanding of the possibilities that watercolor offers and learned that a theme can be approached in multiple ways. I hope this painting resonates with viewers and brings them the tranquility of a quiet morning.
