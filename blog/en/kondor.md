# 50 Years of the Kondor Circle

This year marks a special milestone for the **Kondor Circle** – the art group celebrates its **50th anniversary**. To honor the occasion, a **jubilee exhibition** was organized, featuring works from both current and former members. It was a great honor for me that **one of my Kondor Circle drawings** was also selected for display.

## The Significance of the Kondor Circle

The Kondor Circle has always been more than just a drawing class. It is a **community** where a love of art, the desire to improve, and friendship meet. Here I truly learned what it means to **observe details**, **understand form**, and **express emotion** through lines and tones.

## The Jubilee Exhibition

The exhibition offers a rich variety of artworks — from **charcoal and ink drawings** to **watercolors and pastels**, showcasing the diverse artistic world of the Kondor Circle.  
My own piece is a more recent drawing, created shortly before the exhibition, and it reflects how much I’ve grown artistically thanks to the Kondor Circle.

This event was not only a moment of reflection, but also a source of inspiration for the future. It feels wonderful to see how much talent and creativity has flourished within this community over fifty years — and to know that I can be part of this artistic legacy.
