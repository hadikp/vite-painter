# Mail Art Exhibition â€“ Between Greece and Hungary

The **Mobil BÃ³dÃ© Gallery** is bringing to life a truly special project: artworks by Greek and Hungarian artists are being exchanged and exhibited in each otherâ€™s countries. As part of this cultural dialogue, I created four unique pieces, each using a different technique.

## My exhibited artworks

### 1. **Hard Pastel â€“ Turtle**
This hard pastel drawing depicts a friendly turtle, brought to life with delicate tones and detailed features. The pastel technique allowed me to highlight the texture of the shell and the playful personality of the animal.

### 2. **Soft Pastel â€“ Amaryllis**
The special form and vibrant colors of the amaryllis flower inspired this piece. The soft pastels blend beautifully, giving the petals a light and floating appearance. The warm, welcoming tones celebrate the beauty of nature.

### 3. **Charcoal Drawing â€“ Ballerina**
The ballerinaâ€™s movement is graceful and elegant. The strength and simplicity of charcoal bring a unique mood to the image, while the play of light and shadow enhances the dynamic motion. This drawing is a celebration of the expressive power of the human body.

### 4. **Watercolor â€“ VizipÃ³k and Water Spider**
One of my childhood favorites, VizipÃ³k (Water Spider), comes to life in this watercolor painting. The vibrant yet soft colors evoke a playful and nostalgic atmosphere, sure to bring a smile to viewers of all ages.

## The significance of the exhibition

To me, this project is a celebration of cultural dialogue and shared inspiration. It is an honor to have the Hungarian artworks displayed in **Athens**, while the Greek pieces will be arriving in **Budapest**. I hope these small mail art pieces bring joy to their viewers and serve as a bridge between two countries through art.
