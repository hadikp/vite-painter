  "about": [
    "<p>My name is Péter Hadik, a Hungarian painter and illustrator. I work as an IT specialist, and I used to be a ",
     "chemical engineer. I believe that everyone should find an activity that completely relaxes and slows them down. ",
     "In our fast-paced daily lives, this is essential. For me, painting and gardening fulfill this need. When I pick up ",
     "a brush, I find myself in a completely different world within minutes. When I create, the outside world disappears, ",
     "leaving only the canvas, the paint, the subject, and me. Painting is not just a hobby for me, it is my passion.</p>",
     
     "<p>I enjoy painting landscapes and the vibrant streets of cities. I see a challenge in every meticulously detailed ",
     "subject. The medium doesn’t matter—whether it's acrylic or pastel, I enjoy working with both. In my paintings, I ",
     "love how colors blend under my hand and how the different layers make the figures increasingly intriguing. In every ",
     "subject, I seek life; in my view, even a still life is beautiful when it vibrates with life, through the interplay ",
     "of colors and lights.</p>",

     "<p>Recognition is a wonderful feeling. If a visual experience I've created resonates with someone else, and they ",
     "purchase it and take it home, I feel pride and happiness. Each time I hand over a painting, I gain new motivation ",
     "to continue exploring new experiences, landscapes, people, living beings, and stories that I can paint and share, ",
     "perhaps with you too.</p>",

     "<p>I hope that when you look at my paintings, you feel the atmosphere and step into my world. If you decide to hang ",
     "one of my paintings on your wall, it is a tremendous honor for me. I thank you for supporting my passion.</p>",

     "<p>Let's take a look at the paintings!</p>"
